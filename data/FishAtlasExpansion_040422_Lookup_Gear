4,"BSEINE-WCS","Robard's small beach seine","beach seine","3.1x15 m beach seine is used to sample fish at any location where beaches allowed for deployment (e.g., sandy with no protruding rocks). We walk the net out to about 20 m into the water then draw it parallel to shore the retrieved the net in a symmetrical manner with people drawing the wing lines attached to the net’s ends simultaneously at a constant rate. When the depth of the lagoon will not allow a walk set we perform a similar tow using the boat to drag the net and pull it parallel to the shore."

32,"FYKE-vonBiela","von Biela's fyke net","fyke net","Fyke nets consisted of a lead net extending perpendicular from the shoreline connected to the middle of a metal framed trap. A set of net wings extended from the side of the metal frame, angled toward the shoreline. Fish swimming along the shoreline encounter the lead net and are funneled towards the trap and collected in the cod-end. Fyke nets have been used extensively to study fishes in the Beaufort Sea as they are less-size selective, less-lethal, and are less-destructive to habitat than nearly any alternative (e.g., gillnet, beam trawl) and can be fished unattended for ~24 h. In addition, fyke nets are effective at catching fish because many species travel parallel to the shoreline of lagoons in between forays to other locations in the central part of the lagoons and other coastal areas (Craig, 1984). Fyke net specifications were similar among the sampling eras with a 61 m lead net and 15 m net wings constructed of 2.54 cm stretch mesh and the fyke net trap with an opening of 1.5 m wide and 1.2 m height made from 1.27 cm stretch mesh. The fyke net trap was set away from the shoreline at a water depth of ~1 m and no more than 60 m distance from shore. "
6,"FYKE-WCS","Robard's fyke net","fyke net","Fyke net is constructed with 3.1 mm stretch mesh, a 91.5 x 122 cm frame made of two rectangular conduit frames, 5 steel hoops, 2 throats, and a 15.2 m lead. The wings are anchored using rebar with the main line attached perpendicular to shore and the wings set at approximately 45˚. Set time for fyke nets was more standardized than scientific gillnets throughout the three field seasons, however soak time still varied between sets to avoid mortality where catches were large."

7,"GILLNET-WCS","Robard's experimental gill net","gill net","Experimental gill nets consist of 5 panels, each 25ft in length, for a total net length of 125ft. Stretch measurement of the individual panels were: 1 inch, 1.5 inch, 2 inch, 3 inch, and 4 inch. Set sites are selected in areas near the inflow/outflow (regardless of whether the connection is  open or closed), and points next to water quality sample points through the lagoon (i.e., central, marine edge, terrestrial edge and freshwater inlet ). Soaking nets are monitored in order to minimize risk of a) birds or other unintended animals being caught, and b) unnecessarily heavy fish mortalities. Set times vary based on success rate at the sample site. We use fyke nets to collect larger volumes of fish in locations where the depth and substrate were favorable."

I don't think we ever captured any fish with that so I doubt any trawls from 2017 made it in the data set you had. Ken uses this gear for inverts and once I saw it in action, we figured it just wasn't useful for fish and I started bringing the 3m PSBT."
