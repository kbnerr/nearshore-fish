Description of Files

This folder contains files defined by year and project(s), then split into datasets for site, environmental, and biogolical (fish) information. These datasets are saved as .csv files which can then be loaded into the R Project Environment. The .csv files are created from 'master' .xlsx files and have gone thru initial QA/QC check by hand. Master files are created each year in conjunction with project data collection. Files were re-visited in 2022 to update this file workflow. As a result, earlier .csv files are less congruent from the master file than more recent years.

Files without years contain general information, e.g., a running list of species encountered or sites visited.
