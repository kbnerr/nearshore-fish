# Background on nearshore fish research

## Topic introduction

The marine nearshore is the relatively narrow band of waters along any oceanic coast. It is an environment that provides important ecosystem services for numerous fish species [review in @Beck.etal.2001]. Most notably the nearshore strongly impacts juvenile life stages through habitat benefits as described in the nursery role hypothesis, which states that nurseries in comparison to other habitats "must support greater contributions to adult recruitment from any combination of four factors: (1) density, (2) growth, (3) survival of juveniles, and (4) movement to adult habitats." [@Beck.etal.2001]. This hypothesis and related concepts were made popular in the 1990-2000s, and its study continues in the current literature [@Deegan.1993; @Gillanders.etal.2003; @Dahlgren.etal.2006; @Litvin.etal.2018; @Whitfield.etal.2023]. Recently researchers have incorporated findings from other fields of ecology and statistics, adopting new approaches to data collection and analysis afforded by modern methods to build understanding of the nearshore nursery role [e.g., @Sebatian.etal.2021; @Baker.etal.2021; @Swadling.etal.2024].

Much of the contents of the nursery role hypothesis have become paradigm, supported by numerous studies documenting the occurrence, abundance, and growth of juveniles in nearshore habitats [@Sogard.1997; @Morin.etal.1992; @Lazzari.etal.2003; @Selleslagh.Amara.2008; @Nicolas.etal.2010; @Whitfield.Patrick.2015; @Moore.etal.2016; @Souza.Vianna.2020]. In the last two decades, there has been strong support in the literature for expansion of nearshore benefits to include ideas like habitat connectivity and ‘seascape’ effects [@Ray.2005; @Nagelkerken.etal.2015; @Litvin.etal.2018; @Seitz.etal.2020]. These migration-dependent topics have mostly been studied for singular taxa then synthesized in meta-analysis [@Gillanders.etal.2003; @Minello.etal.2003; @Hodgson.etal.2020; @Whitfield.etal.2023]. Relatively few nearshore studies have been able to address this at the community level [but see @Sheaves.Johnston.2009; @Valesini.etal.2014; @Ricart.etal.2018], although doing so would improve understanding of how connectivity functions with other ecological mechanisms that affect fishes, such as species interactions, trophic dynamics, or changes to habitat quality (e.g., shifts in physicochemical conditions) [@Able.2005; @Sheaves.2009; @Sheaves.etal.2015].

Issues of scale add an additional level of complexity to our understanding of communities in relation their environment. In the field community ecology, sample autocorrelation and scale-mediated effects are known hurdles to overcome if studies seek to generalize beyond local scales [@Legendre.Fortin.1989; @Fukami.2004; @Irvine.etal.2011; @Dray.etal.2012; @Guenard.Legendre.2018]. In the last couple decades, increased attention to climate effects have linked anomalous environmental observations with potential ecosystem responses and raised concerns for future resource management [@Rindorf.Lewy.2006; @Lindmark.etal.2019; @Reinl.etal.2025]. In areas where long-term environmental data exist, species and community metrics can be related to multi-year or decadal patterns [@Atrill.Power.2002; @Siwertsson.etal.2024; @Araujo.etal.2025], or biological outcomes can be inferred from periodically defined events (e.g., human activities, historic floods, MHWs) [@Cloern.etal.2016; @Bachand.Walsh.2022; @Ziegler.etal.2023]. Climate measurements exhibit basin-wide patterns but will also vary among sites [@Danielson.etal.2022]. Spatial scales in nearshore fish data must be addressed while considering the study's temporal scope, especially since models of fish–environment relationships will differ in how they fit and disentangle autocorrelation effects [@Viana.etal.2022].

## Community structuring

Nearshore fish community structure has been researched globally for decades, where a particular density of studies come from temperate regions of Europe, Australia, and South Africa [@Potter.etal.1990; @Harrison.Whitfield.2006; @Elliott.etal.2007; @Sheaves.2009; @Sheaves.etal.2015; @Whitfield.2020]. Although relatively less prominent in the literature, impactful studies also come from various parts of the Americas and more polar regions of Europe [@Deegan.1993; @Stenseth.etal.2002; @Rueda.Defeo.2003; @Sielfeld.etal.2010; @Barcelo.etal.2016]. Most bodies of research have started at the local scale comparing community structure (as alpha and beta diversity) to physicochemical conditions among sites that are \~10s of km apart [@Blaber.Blaber.1980; @Morin.etal.1992; @Potter.etal.1997; @Bennett.1989]. The studied conditions are typically hypothesized a priori and have resulted in significant effects from temperature, salinity, turbidity, or water velocity [@Cyrus.Blaber.1987; @Bottom.Jones.1990; @Abookire.etal.2000; @Rueda.Defeo.2003; @Maes.etal.2004; @Sosa-Lopez.etal.2007; @MarinJarrin.Shanks.2011; @Kisten.etal.2019]. Numerous additional metrics of water quality and physical conditions have also been found to be important, although which parameters that result in highest impact can differ based on the study area [@Stoner.Abookire.2002; @Jaafar.etal.2004; @Maes.etal.2004; @Mateo.Tobias.2004; @Nunoo.etal.2006; @Selleslagh.Amara.2008; @Franca.etal.2012], and so early studies tend to acknowledge uncertainty when translating their findings to other systems. Comparison of habitat types is another common study design at the sub-region scale [@Dean.etal.2000; @Lazzari.etal.2003; @Johnson.etal.2010; @Schein.etal.2012]. Review of such work found that structured habitats (e.g., seagrass, mangroves, kelp forests) are almost always more beneficial in terms of nursery role functions than unstructured habitats (e.g., bare substrate, open water) [@Minello.etal.2003; @Lerfcheck.etal.2019].

### Spatial structures

At larger spatial scales, variability in community structure is dominated by factors that differ among ecosystems, such as latitude and coastal formation, rather than those that more so characterize the site level like hydrology or habitat. The overall pool of species varies with latitude, or more generally distance, on the scale of regions (1000s of km) [@Ojeda.etal.2000; @Sielfeld.etal.2010; @Navarrete.etal.2014]. Additionally, communities are either described in the context of marine or estuarine settings (sometimes referred to as ‘transitional waters’) because of the physiological limits that produce euryhaline-adapted fishes [@Beck.etal.2001; @Whitfield.Patrick.2015; @Bradley.etal.2019]. Studies also find differences in community structure when comparing systems with contrasting geomorphologies [@Franca.etal.2012; @ShahEsmaeili.etal.2022; @Laske.etal.2024]. These comparisons are somewhat intuitive among systems (10s to 100s of km), where researchers can easily delineate samples based on coastal type (e.g., open beaches, bights, fjords, lagoons), sub-type (e.g., closed, open, semi-open) or associated features (e.g., watershed type, freshwater source, anthropogenic influence) using geographic calculations such as total area, shoreline complexity, or distances among features [@Rueda.Defeo.2003; @Harrison.Whitfield.2006; @Nicolas.etal.2010; @Miller.etal.2014]. Generally, nearshore communities vary at multiple spatial scales: structural differences among sites (beta diversity) can be attributed to a multitude of factors or gradients that depend on the context of the system, whereas structural changes (gamma diversity) and patterns across systems and regions (zeta diversity) are similarly scaled to mechanisms operating on the broader species pool [@Pittman.etal.2004; @Sielfeld.etal.2010; @Hattab.etal.2015; @Pasquaud.etal.2015; ].

### Temporal structures

Despite wide spatial variability, dominance by juvenile life stages in the community is ubiquitous among nearshore studies. Assessments of species or community change over shorter time scales (e.g., night vs day, tidal fluctuations, seasonal periods) are therefore common due to the variability in ontogenetic patterns exhibited by community members [@Elliot.etal.2007; @Potter.etal.2015] . Seasonal patterns of occurrence and abundance are often attributed to the different life history stages that functionally drive fishes into the nearshore such as the various forms of diadromy [e.g., @Ray.2005]. Nearshore residence, recruitment timing, and size have also been related to seasonal prey availability, hydrological gradients, and habitat features, among other (often system-specific) factors [@Moore.etal.2016; @Kindong.etal.2020; @Barton.etal.2020; @Luo.etal.2023]. While seasonal influences have been widely reported, interannual effects have been less common and appear more difficult to explain. Studies that do include interannual variability have typically reported on shorter periods (\~2-4 yrs) [e.g., @Thedinga.etal.2013; @Roux.etal.2016; @Sutton.etal.2025], which is insufficient data to discern whether observations represent a response to environmental gradients or if caused by population dynamics that exhibit interannual cycles [see for example @Beaudreau.etal.2022; @Laurel.etal.2023].

More recent literature has been able to discuss long term change because some places have accrued large time series of community observations (several years to decades). Studies can couple these data with long-term environmental monitoring datasets [e.g., @Cloern.etal.2016] or oceanographic oscillation indices (e.g., ENSO, NAO, PDO) [@Collie.etal.2008; @Sielfeld.etal.2010]. Structural changes in species residency, abundance, density, and growth have been linked to shifts in the environment described by anomalous conditions, oceanographic gradients, and habitat disturbances [@Baptista.etal.2015; @Barcelo.etal.2016; @Amorim.etal.2017; @Beukhof.etal.2019; @Langan.etal.2021; @Priest.etal.2022; @Castillo.etal.2023]. Where consistent yearly observations are difficult to obtain, studies make comparisons among periods surrounding large disturbances (e.g., MHWs, habitat alteration) [@Heintz.etal.2013; @Ziegler.etal.2023; @Almeida.etal.2024]. There is evidence that nursery functions may be reduced due to long-term disturbances [@Sebatian.etal.2021], although conservation areas (e.g., MPAs) may have a mitigating effect during and after these periods [@Ziegler.etal.2023]. Community variability over long-term temporal periods can be a useful metric for discovering structural shifts attributed environmental change (e.g., climate, habitat, regime) as opposed to interannual dynamics. Identifying the exact mechanisms of change that drive community shifts likely still lies in our understanding at the individual species and population level [see for example @Laurel.etal.2016].

## Findings from Alaska

Community-level nearshore fish research in Alaska began in earnest in the 1970’s when state and federal agencies sought biological assessments for emergent fisheries and lease openings for oil extraction. These early coastal studies were focused around the Beaufort Sea, SEAK, and northern GOA, and in the latter specifically Kodiak, lower Cook Inlet, and Prince William Sound [@Craig.1984; @Rogers.etal.1986]. Additional community assessments have since been conducted (ca. 1980s to now) expanding the existing sample area coverage but also creating new datasets from parts of the Aleutian Islands, Bering Sea, and Chukchi Sea [e.g., @Sigler.etal.2001; @Rooper.Boldt.2005; @Farley.etal.2005; @Thedinga.etal.2013]. In many cases, these areas have produced findings on how their communities are structured in addition to baseline assemblage information. However, nearshore fish information still does not exist for most of Alaska’s huge coastline. Compared to other nearshore research across the globe, Alaska has sparse data relative to its physical size. Spatially explicit models can be used to fill gaps, associating fish with coastal datasets like habitat maps or hydrological observations [@Coffin.Mueter.2016; @Parada.etal.2016; @Gruss.etal.2021], but community-level models have rarely been done [but see @Miller.etal.2014; @Miller.etal.2015]. Information can also be contributed to an extent by fisheries-specific studies, which have been much more frequent and widespread throughout the state. In these cases, nearshore fish information comes mostly from research on Pacific salmon (*Oncorhynchus spp.*) and commercially important groundfishes.

### Pacific salmon

Pacific salmon occur throughout coastal Alaska and may be the best studied fish group in the state. Interest in nearshore habitats comes from a need to better understand an early life phase when salmon transition from fresh to marine habitats (outmigration) that coincides with a physiological transition (smoltification) requiring increased foraging to meet metabolic demands [@McCormick.Saunders.1987]. Outmigration happens in spring and early summer, but timing of recruitment into the nearshore and residence periods vary among species and populations [@Orsi.etal.2000; @Olsen.etal.2003; @Moore.etal.2016]. In general, pink (*O. gorbuscha*) and chum (*O. keta*) move into the nearshore earliest as YOY [@Jaenicke.etal.1985], but chinook (*O. tshawytscha*), sockeye (*O. nerka*), and coho (*O. kisutch*) can spend multiple years in freshwater habitats before outmigration [@Moulton.etal.1997]. However, some chinook and coho populations exhibit seasonal nearshore and estuarine habitat usage between rearing years [@Koski.2009; @Hoem-Neher.etal.2013; @MarinJarrin.Miller.2013]. Juvenile salmon differ in their spatial distributions as well [@Farley.etal.2005], relating to environmental factors that can be scale-dependent but also vary among species, population, or sub-population levels [@Olsen.etal.2003; @Hart.2023]. During nearshore residency, juvenile salmon can dominate community assemblages making them potentially important forage species [@Springer.etal.1997]. Release of hatchery stocks can affect their role as prey [@Malick.etal.2009; @Duncan.2018], and additionally may change community dynamics such as competition with wild stocks or other species [@Murphy.etal.1988; @Orsi.etal.2004; @Wessel.2004; @Blikshteyn.2005; @Moss.etal.2009]. Nearshore residence is seen as critical in terms of marine mortality, where juvenile energy and growth may have positive relationships with spawner recruitment and adult success [@Linley.2001; @Powers.etal.2006; @Malick.etal.2009]. But, limited means to track populations in the open ocean makes the exact impact of the nearshore difficult to discern from influences in the pelagic ecosystem [but see @Yasumiishi.etal.2016; @Deeg.etal.2025].

### Groundfishes

Groundfish research was heavily pursued in the 90s resulting from a regime shift in the North Pacific. This shift was documented in fisheries datasets following a switch in the PDO (negative to positive) in the late 70s [@Litzow.2006]. During these years (\~ '76-'97), biomass concentration changed from mid-trophic crustaceans (shrimp and crab) and pelagic forage species (capelin and herring) to upper trophic groundfishes [@Anderson.Piatt.1999]. Big winners of the regime shift were gadids (*Gadidae*) and various flatfishes (*Pleuronectidae*), both of which became large fisheries in the state. Similar to Pacific salmon research, studies sought to better understand growth, energetics, and recruitment to adult stages in these emergent fisheries, which led to examinations of nearshore functions on juveniles [e.g., @Abookire.etal.2001].

#### Gadids

From a resource perspective, Pacific cod (*Gadus macrocephalus*) and walleye pollock (*Theragra chalcogramma*) represent the most important fisheries so have received a lot of attention.

hatch in offshore waters in late March-early May then currents transport larva into the nearshore to rear throughout the warm summer months [@Kendall.etal.1996; @Hurst.etal.2009]. Once settled in the nearshore, gadids exhibit a habitat preference for seagrass and subcanopy kelp beds but also migrate among less-structured habitats in close proximity [@Markis.2007; @Laurel.etal.2007; @Hurst.etal.2015].

Other demersal fishes:

-   Juvenile sablefish spend majority of their time in deeper waters, but will migrate into shallower habitats during slack high usually at dawn potentially linked to foraging [@Coutre.2014]

#### Flatfishes

Flatfish species, such as Pacific halibut and rock sole, also spawn offshore then rear in nearshore waters during summer [@Abookire.Norcross.1998; ]. But by contrast, flatfishes tend towards unstructured habitats associated with mostly sand or fine-grain substrates [@Abookire.Norcross.1998; @Markis.2007; ].

Except for salmon, which are known to rear in rivers for multiple years, these young-of-the-year fishes will migrate to slightly deeper marine depths during winter and return to shallow habitat the next summer [@Laurel.etal.2009; @Norcross.etal.2001]. But similarly as salmon, some species will do this two or more times before moving on to adult habitats.

### Forage fishes

Some of the most important forage species in Alaska also exhibit this annual shallow-to-deep (summer-to-winter) migration (references). Although, forage species differ somewhat because they also use nearshore habitat as spawning areas [e.g., herring; @Norcross.etal.2001], including in the intertidal [e.g., capelin; @Ressel.2019] and in lower-river reachers [e.g., eulachon; @Spangler.2020]. The large majority of nearshore community members exhibit seasonal patterns in migration and rearing (references). This is why community analyses almost always attribute a large portion of overall variance to seasonality.

### Community-level studies

The study areas where assessments occurred in the 70’s are still the most consistently sampled areas today. The nearshore nursery role is consistent within each area’s body of work, but the research focus often differs in terms of target species or habitat factors deemed influential. Nearshore research from the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea stand out more so than others because of the difference in species pool at Arctic latitudes, with many studies focusing on Arctic cod in particular (references). Although, recent evidence of species borealization (e.g., increase in chinook, pollock, dolly varden) suggests an ongoing community shift in the Arctic region [@Logerwell.etal.2015; @Barton.etal.2020; @Wildes.etal.2022; @vonBiela.etal.2023]. Arctic research has also uniquely investigated the community structure of lagoon habitats, as well as identifying wind as a significant factor in structuring beach communities (references). Southeast AK has perhaps the largest body of work, with numerous coastal towns (relative to the rest of Alaska) and multiple marine research institutions based in the area (UA, ADFG, NOAA) (references). Compared to other regions, SEAK nearshore research includes a more diverse array of topics including differential habitat usage among juvenile rockfishes, importance of seagrass beds for juvenile salmon, hatchery salmon impacts, hydrological influences from watershed features (e.g., glacial coverage or snowpack), and trophic dynamics of estuarine residents (e.g., staghorn sculpin, dolly varden, starry flounder) [@Mattes.2004; @Whitney.etal.2018]. Prince William Sound has also developed a relatively dense body of work, and similar to SEAK has examined nearshore roles concerning juvenile rockfishes (i.e., copper and lingcod), hatchery salmon, and habitat comparisons between seagrass and kelp beds among others. Unique to PWS is a large knowledge base concerning the area’s Pacific herring, which stems from a strong interest in understanding its population crash after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 [@Pearson.etal.1999; ]. Similarly, research in Lower Cook Inlet can attribute some of its efforts to oil spill recovery as historic and recent oil leases prompted environmental assessments in the area. LCI research has produced studies on habitat preferences in juvenile flatfish (e.g., arrowtooth, halibut, rock sole) and oceanographic structuring of forage fish populations (e.g., capelin, gadids, Pacific sand lance) (references).

An interesting aspect of this forage fish research has been a focus on energetics, feeding, and spawning behavior of local Pacific sand lance populations (references). – Why is this interesting?

In Kodiak, an impressive body of work has been built describing the recruitment, habitat preference, and growth of juvenile pollock and Pacific cod over multiple years (references). One important finding has been the reduced effect of nursery habitat on gadid success during marine heatwave periods, suggesting that the timing of hatch date was most influential in determining the success of YOY cohorts (references).

While the study areas highlighted above have maintained different research themes, there has also been a fair amount of cross pollination among the various parts of the state (e.g., a Pacific halibut study from the Bering Sea), as well as contributions that span multiple areas and taxa. Although, these studies usually concern singular species or a group of species (e.g., a forage fish study across the northern GOA) (references). Juvenile salmon and gadid research has been the most widespread in Alaska since these taxa are relatively commonplace and receive increased attention for resource management reasons (references). An example outcome of this was a recently produced species habitat model linking pollock and cod juveniles with physical coastal features in both SEAK and PWS (reference). Other widespread topics include the study of similar environmental drivers of species or community metrics. These often include the physicochemical parameters of temperature and salinity, and habitat factors like structure type and density (as in seagrass beds) or other physical descriptors like depth and substrate (references). Direct regional comparisons at the community level have been rare (except see (references). However, some studies have examined variability in community among multiple systems (e.g., comparison of sites within and among embayments), for example across larger areas (1000s of km) like the northern GOA, PWS, SEAK, and the Arctic (references). Seasonality and habitat factors (e.g., kelp vs seagrass) were commonly reported influences on diversity and abundance, as well as structural differences in community linked to landscape-derived factors and interannual comparisons (references). A recent study comparing two systems, Kachemak Bay in LCI and Lynn Canal in SEAK, reported a regional difference in community mean and variance driven by contrasting hydrological settings (references). The more ocean-exposed Kachemak Bay exhibited interannual variability in taxonomic structure correlated with temperature, salinity, and turbidity; whereas, community variability in the more freshwater-exposed Lynn Canal had a weak interannual effect and instead exhibited stronger seasonal effects relating to salinity and watershed discharge (reference). This same study looked at functional diversity, which had not previously been done on nearshore fish communities in Alaska, and found weak correlations with local conditions in both systems. This suggests that if temporal shifts occur (over years) in nearshore fish communities then drivers are likely operating at larger spatial scales instead of smaller ones.

Community analysis was developed recognizing ecological principles based on species interactions and was meant to address questions of biodiversity, conservation, management, and change over time, where single-taxa studies were either inadequate (e.g., too costly or time consuming to string together) or simply inappropriate (e.g., need for samples coupling multiple taxa). While nearshore fish research in Alaska has been built over multiple decades, the information available in the literature lacks cohesion in terms of data analyses, ecological interpretation, and future outlook at the community level. In the last decade, other branches of ecology have led the way in performing analyses from a community perspective (e.g., multivariate inference models, joint species distributions, variable reduction). Some of these methods have already been applied to Alaskan nearshore fish communities, namely ordination and ANOVA based approaches. However, broad-scale analyses are still a gap considering the breadth of available datasets in both time and space compared to what has been done in other parts of the world. My dissertation aims to develop a cohesive understanding of nearshore fish community variability at the local-to-system scale, as well as at the region-to-region scale, and to examine if and how communities have changed over longer time periods. In my opinion, these are requisite analyses that will result in useful outcomes for fisheries management and ecosystem models, and will lead to next step analyses like those found in other branches of ecology.

# Proposed chapters

For chapter 1, I ask which physicochemical parameters and habitat factors structure nearshore fish communities within a system. Namely, I examine variance partitioned among temperature, salinity, tubidity, bay location, and site exposure (protected vs exposed) as water velocity. The goal of this chapter is to build upon existing knowledge of a well-studied system, and further our understanding of system-wide influences on community structuring.

-   

For chapter 2, I ask how nearshore fish communities are structured at varying spatial scales. In this chapter I expand the scale of study to include samples spread across multiple systems, first examining spatial autocorrelation and then parsing community variance among grouped samples (system-to-regional scales) with coastal habitat features that vary at the local level. The goal of this chapter is to uilize the range of data available in Alaska (namely the Gulf of Alaska) to empirically determine appropriate spatial groupings of community samples for further analyses.

-   Macroecology

For chapter 3, I ask if and how nearshore fish communities have changed over long-term periods (years-to-decades) coinciding with known climate-related trends. Specifically, I look for patterns in community variability surrounding the marine heatwave that affected the Gulf of Alaska from 2014-2016. The goal of this chapter is to apply findings from other nearshore fish research which hypothesized effects on nursery function during years with anomalously warm water temperatures.

-   Climate change

-   Marine Heatwaves

# Approach

An early review of initial nearshore fish community assessments described a variety of gear types utilized, including trawls, seines, passive nets (e.g., gill, try, fyke), hook-and-line, and SCUBA. Each gear type resulted in different community assemblages, but beach seines had the lowest selectivity especially in inshore areas where juveniles are most accomodated according to the reduced predator paradigm. In chapter 1, I collect new data in the study area of Kachemak Bay which represents a relatively well-studied system in terms of historical community assessments and published findings. This will provide me with a firm grasp of the sampling method, which will allow for a better understanding of how samples should be treated in data preparation and analyses. In chapters 2 and 3, I leverage the NOAA Nearshore Fish Atlas of Alaska database which aggregates data from numerous studies (\~20) conducted over multiple years (ca. 1990s to present). I will subset the NFAA and perform data preparations to fit the research question in either chapter. Although, I expect to focus on data collected from the GOA broadly (from SEAK to Aleutian Islands) due to the density of studies on hand, as well as existing broad-scale ecosystem definitions (e.g., east vs west GOA) that can be tested using nearshore fish data which would be novel.
