# Background on nearshore fish research

## Topic introduction

The marine nearshore is the relatively narrow band of waters along any oceanic coast. It is an environment that provides important ecosystem services for numerous fish species [review in @Beck.etal.2001]. Most notably the nearshore strongly impacts juvenile life stages through habitat benefits as described in the nursery role hypothesis, which states that nurseries in comparison to other habitats "must support greater contributions to adult recruitment from any combination of four factors: (1) density, (2) growth, (3) survival of juveniles, and (4) movement to adult habitats." [@Beck.etal.2001]. This hypothesis and related concepts were made popular in the 1990-2000s, and its study continues in the current literature [@Deegan.1993; @Gibson.1994; @Houde.1997; @Gillanders.etal.2003; @Dahlgren.etal.2006; @Litvin.etal.2018; @Whitfield.etal.2023]. Recently researchers have incorporated findings from other fields of ecology and statistics, adopting new approaches to data collection and analysis afforded by modern methods to further understanding of nearshore functions [see @Sebatian.etal.2021; @Baker.etal.2021; @Swadling.etal.2024].

Much of the contents of the nursery role hypothesis have become paradigm, supported by numerous studies documenting the occurrence, abundance, and growth of juveniles in nearshore habitats [@Sogard.1997; @Morin.etal.1992; @Lazzari.etal.2003; @Selleslagh.Amara.2008; @Nicolas.etal.2010; @Whitfield.Patrick.2015; @Moore.etal.2016; @Souza.Vianna.2020]. In the last two decades, there has been strong support in the literature for expansion of nearshore benefits to include ideas like habitat connectivity and ‘seascape’ effects [@Ray.2005; @Nagelkerken.etal.2015; @Litvin.etal.2018; @Seitz.etal.2020]. These migration-dependent topics have mostly been studied for singular taxa then synthesized in meta-analysis [@Gillanders.etal.2003; @Minello.etal.2003; @Hodgson.etal.2020; @Whitfield.etal.2023]. Relatively few nearshore studies have been able to address this at the community level [c.f., @Sheaves.Johnston.2009; @Valesini.etal.2014; @Ricart.etal.2018], although doing so would improve understanding of how connectivity functions with other ecological mechanisms that affect fishes, such as species interactions, trophic dynamics, or changes to habitat quality and quantity [@Gibson.1994; @Tjelmeland.1997 @Able.1999; @Able.2005; @Sheaves.2009; @Sheaves.etal.2015].

Issues of scale add an additional level of complexity to our understanding of communities in relation their environment [@Wiens.1989; @Levin.1992; @Chave.2013]. In the field of community ecology, sample autocorrelation and scale-mediated effects are known hurdles to overcome if studies wish to generalize beyond a particular system [@Legendre.Fortin.1989; @Fukami.2004; @Irvine.etal.2011; @Dray.etal.2012; @Guenard.Legendre.2018]. Climate issues have been given increased attention recently, where studies have linked anomalous environmental observations with potential ecosystem responses and raised concerns for future resource management [@Rindorf.Lewy.2006; @Lindmark.etal.2019; @Reinl.etal.2025]. In areas where long-term environmental data exist, species and community metrics can be related to multi-year or decadal patterns [@Atrill.Power.2002; @Siwertsson.etal.2024; @Araujo.etal.2025], or biological outcomes can be inferred from periodically defined events (e.g., human activities, historic floods, MHWs) [@Cloern.etal.2016; @Bachand.Walsh.2022; @Ziegler.etal.2023]. Oceanographic measurements at a basin-wide scale exhibit similar trends in the long-term but coastal observations can vary in magnitude or even contrast with the regional pattern [@Danielson.etal.2022], making nearshore community assessments dependent on local contexts as well as regional ones. Spatial scales in nearshore fish data must be addressed while considering the study's temporal scope, especially since models of fish–environment relationships will differ in how they fit and disentangle autocorrelation effects [@Viana.etal.2022].

## Community structuring

Nearshore fish community structure has been researched globally for decades, where a particular density of studies come from temperate regions of Europe, Australia, and South Africa [@Potter.etal.1990; @Harrison.Whitfield.2006; @Elliott.etal.2007; @Sheaves.2009; @Sheaves.etal.2015; @Whitfield.2020]. Although relatively less prominent in the literature, impactful studies also come from various parts of the Americas and more polar regions of Europe [@Deegan.1993; @Stenseth.etal.2002; @Rueda.Defeo.2003; @Sielfeld.etal.2010; @Barcelo.etal.2016]. Most bodies of research have started at the local scale comparing community structure (as alpha and beta diversity) to physicochemical conditions among sites that are \~10s of km apart [@Blaber.Blaber.1980; @Morin.etal.1992; @Potter.etal.1997; @Bennett.1989]. The studied conditions are typically hypothesized a priori and have resulted in significant effects from temperature, salinity, turbidity, or water velocity [@Cyrus.Blaber.1987; @Bottom.Jones.1990; @Abookire.etal.2000; @Rueda.Defeo.2003; @Maes.etal.2004; @Sosa-Lopez.etal.2007; @MarinJarrin.Shanks.2011; @Kisten.etal.2019]. Numerous additional metrics of water quality and physical conditions have also been found to be important, although which parameters that result in highest impact can differ based on the study area [@Stoner.Abookire.2002; @Jaafar.etal.2004; @Maes.etal.2004; @Mateo.Tobias.2004; @Nunoo.etal.2006; @Selleslagh.Amara.2008; @Franca.etal.2012], and so early studies tend to acknowledge uncertainty when translating their findings to other systems. Comparison of habitat types is another common study design at the sub-region scale [@Dean.etal.2000; @Lazzari.etal.2003; @Johnson.etal.2010; @Schein.etal.2012]. Review of such work found that structured habitats (e.g., seagrass, mangroves, kelp forests) are almost always more beneficial in terms of nursery role functions than unstructured habitats (e.g., bare substrate, open water) [@Minello.etal.2003; @Lerfcheck.etal.2019].

### Spatial structure

At larger spatial scales, variability in community structure is dominated by factors that differ among ecosystems, such as latitude and coastal formation, rather than those that more so characterize the site level like hydrology or habitat. The overall pool of species varies with latitude, or more generally distance, on the scale of regions (1000s of km) [@Ojeda.etal.2000; @Sielfeld.etal.2010; @Navarrete.etal.2014]. Additionally, communities are either described in the context of marine or estuarine settings (sometimes referred to as ‘transitional waters’) because of the physiological limits that produce euryhaline-adapted fishes [@Beck.etal.2001; @Whitfield.Patrick.2015; @Bradley.etal.2019]. Studies also find differences in community structure when comparing systems with contrasting geomorphologies [@Franca.etal.2012; @ShahEsmaeili.etal.2022; @Laske.etal.2024]. These comparisons are somewhat intuitive among systems (10s to 100s of km), where researchers can easily delineate samples based on coastal type (e.g., open beaches, bights, fjords, lagoons), sub-type (e.g., closed, open, semi-open) or associated features (e.g., watershed type, freshwater source, anthropogenic influence) using geographic calculations such as total area, shoreline complexity, or distances among features [@Rueda.Defeo.2003; @Harrison.Whitfield.2006; @Nicolas.etal.2010; @Miller.etal.2014]. Generally, nearshore communities vary at multiple spatial scales: structural differences among sites (beta diversity) can be attributed to a multitude of factors or gradients that depend on the context of the system, whereas structural changes (gamma diversity) and patterns across systems and regions (zeta diversity) are similarly scaled to mechanisms operating on the broader species pool [@Pittman.etal.2004; @Sielfeld.etal.2010; @Hattab.etal.2015; @Pasquaud.etal.2015].

### Temporal structure

Despite wide spatial variability, dominance by juvenile life stages in the community is ubiquitous among nearshore studies. Studies report of community patterns over shorter time scales (e.g., night vs day, tidal fluctuations, seasonal periods) [@Maes.etal.2004; @MarrinJarrin.Shanks.2011; @Torre.etal.2017], which is caused by to the variability in ontogenetic patterns exhibited by community members [@Elliot.etal.2007; @Potter.etal.2015]. Therefore, seasonal patterns of occurrence and abundance are often attributed to the different life histories that functionally lead fishes into the nearshore [@ShahEsmaeili.etal.2022], such as the various forms of diadromy [@Ray.2005]. Nearshore residence, recruitment timing, and size have also been related to seasonal prey availability, hydrological gradients, and habitat features, among other (often system-specific) factors [@Moore.etal.2016; @Kindong.etal.2020; @Barton.etal.2020; @Luo.etal.2023]. While seasonal influences have been widely reported, interannual effects are somewhat less common and appear more difficult to explain. Community studies that do analyse interannual effects have typically reported on shorter periods (\~2-4 yrs) [e.g., @Thedinga.etal.2013; @Roux.etal.2016; @Sutton.etal.2025], which is usually insufficient to measure the effect of nearshore function on community members [@Able.1999].

More recent literature has been able to discuss long-term change because some places have accrued large time series of community observations (several years to decades). Researchers can couple these data with long-term environmental monitoring datasets [@Cloern.etal.2016] or oceanographic indices (e.g., ENSO, NAO, PDO) [@Collie.etal.2008; @Sielfeld.etal.2010; @Araujo.etal.2025]. Structural changes in species residency, abundance, density, and growth have been linked to shifts in the environment described by anomalous conditions, physicochemical gradients, and habitat changes [@Baptista.etal.2015; @Barcelo.etal.2016; @Amorim.etal.2017; @Beukhof.etal.2019; @Langan.etal.2021; @Priest.etal.2022; @Castillo.etal.2023]. A number of studies have also compared fish responses among distinct temperal periods defined by shifts in the environment or sometimes by gaps in sample years [e.g., @Heintz.etal.2013; @Ziegler.etal.2023; @Almeida.etal.2024; @Geoghegan.etal.2025]. There is evidence that nursery benefits may be reduced due to periodic disturbances [@Sebatian.etal.2021; @Thalmann.etal.2024], although conservation areas (e.g., MPAs) appear to provide resiliency during and after such periods [@Ziegler.etal.2023]. Community variability over long time scales can be a useful metric for discovering structural shifts attributed environmental change (e.g., climate, habitat, regime) as opposed to cyclical population dynamics. Still, identifying the exact mechanisms driving community shifts likely lies in understanding ontogeny at the species, metapopulation level [see for example @Laurel.etal.2016; @Thalmann.etal.2024].

## Findings from Alaska

Community-level research on Alaskan nearshore fish dates back to the 1970’s when state and federal agencies sought biological assessments for emergent fisheries and resource extraction leases. These early coastal studies were focused around the Beaufort Sea, SEAK, and northern GOA, and in the latter specifically Kodiak, lower Cook Inlet, and Prince William Sound [@Craig.1984; @Rogers.etal.1986]. Additional community assessments have since been conducted (ca. 1980s to now) expanding the existing sample area coverage but also creating new datasets from parts of the Aleutian Islands, Bering Sea, and Chukchi Sea [e.g., @Sigler.etal.2001; @Rooper.Boldt.2005; @Farley.etal.2005; @Thedinga.etal.2013]. In many cases, these areas have produced findings on how their communities are structured in addition to baseline assemblage information.

However, nearshore fish information still does not exist for most of Alaska’s huge coastline. Compared to other nearshore research across the globe, Alaska has sparse data relative to its physical size. Spatially explicit models can be used to fill gaps, associating fish with coastal datasets like habitat maps or hydrological observations [@Coffin.Mueter.2016; @Parada.etal.2016; @Gruss.etal.2021]

but community-level models have rarely been done [c.f., @Miller.etal.2014; @Miller.etal.2015].

Information on nearshore usage has also been contributed by studies focused on particular species or groups [e.g., @Norcross.etal.1999; ].

These studies have been much more frequent and widespread throughout the state but the vast majority have focused on fishes that are either commercially relevant or dominant in the ecosystem, leaving gaps in knowledge on many of the less-abundant taxa.

### Community-level studies

Demersal community structured by depth-temperature gradient, although richness, diversity, abundance were more variable in pattern. Richness/diversity decreased with salinity, but increased with heterogenous sediments. [@Mueter.Norcross1999]

Rock sole, halibut, great sculpin, and P cod were shallow water groundfish species (\<20m) [@Abookire.etal.2001]

When comparing flatfish distributions among systems (10s of km), sediment composition, bedform, warm casings, and temperature were significant model parameters [@Stoner.etal.2007].

The study areas where assessments occurred in the 70’s are still the most consistently sampled areas today. The nearshore nursery role is consistent within each area’s body of work, but the research focus often differs in terms of target species or habitat factors deemed influential. Nearshore research from the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea stand out more so than others because of the difference in species pool at Arctic latitudes, with many studies focusing on Arctic cod in particular (references). Although, recent evidence of species borealization (e.g., increase in chinook, pollock, dolly varden) suggests an ongoing community shift in the Arctic region [@Logerwell.etal.2015; @Barton.etal.2020; @Wildes.etal.2022; @vonBiela.etal.2023]. Arctic research has also uniquely investigated the community structure of lagoon habitats, as well as identifying wind as a significant factor in structuring beach communities (references).

Southeast AK has perhaps the largest body of work, with numerous coastal towns (relative to the rest of Alaska) and multiple marine research institutions based in the area (UA, ADFG, NOAA) (references). Compared to other regions, SEAK nearshore research includes a more diverse array of topics including differential habitat usage among juvenile rockfishes, importance of seagrass beds for juvenile salmon, hatchery salmon impacts, hydrological influences from watershed features (e.g., glacial coverage or snowpack), and trophic dynamics of estuarine residents (e.g., staghorn sculpin, dolly varden, starry flounder) [@Mattes.2004; @Whitney.etal.2018].

Prince William Sound has also developed a relatively dense body of work, and similar to SEAK has examined nearshore roles concerning juvenile rockfishes (i.e., copper and lingcod), hatchery salmon, and habitat comparisons between seagrass and kelp beds among others. Unique to PWS is a large knowledge base concerning the area’s Pacific herring, which stems from a strong interest in understanding its population crash after the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 [@Pearson.etal.1999; ].

Similarly, research in Lower Cook Inlet can attribute some of its efforts to oil spill recovery as historic and recent oil leases prompted environmental assessments in the area. LCI research has produced studies on habitat preferences in juvenile flatfish (e.g., arrowtooth, halibut, rock sole) and oceanographic structuring of forage fish populations (e.g., capelin, gadids, Pacific sand lance) (references).

An interesting aspect of this forage fish research has been a focus on energetics, feeding, and spawning behavior of local Pacific sand lance populations (references). – Why is this interesting?

In Kodiak, an impressive body of work has been built describing the recruitment, habitat preference, and growth of juvenile pollock and Pacific cod over multiple years (references). One important finding has been the reduced effect of nursery habitat on gadid success during marine heatwave periods, suggesting that the timing of hatch date was most influential in determining the success of YOY cohorts (references).

While the study areas highlighted above have maintained different research themes, there has also been a fair amount of cross pollination among the various parts of the state (e.g., a Pacific halibut study from the Bering Sea), as well as contributions that span multiple areas and taxa. Although, these studies usually concern singular species or a group of species (e.g., a forage fish study across the northern GOA) (references). Juvenile salmon and gadid research has been the most widespread in Alaska since these taxa are relatively commonplace and receive increased attention for resource management reasons (references). An example outcome of this was a recently produced species habitat model linking pollock and cod juveniles with physical coastal features in both SEAK and PWS (reference)

Other widespread topics include the study of similar environmental drivers of species or community metrics. These often include the physicochemical parameters of temperature and salinity, and habitat factors like structure type and density (as in seagrass beds) or other physical descriptors like depth and substrate (references).

Direct regional comparisons at the community level have been rare (except see (references). However, some studies have examined variability in community among multiple systems (e.g., comparison of sites within and among embayments), for example across larger areas (1000s of km) like the northern GOA, PWS, SEAK, and the Arctic (references).

Seasonality and habitat factors (e.g., kelp vs seagrass) were commonly reported influences on diversity and abundance, as well as structural differences in community linked to landscape-derived factors and interannual comparisons (references). A recent study comparing two systems, Kachemak Bay in LCI and Lynn Canal in SEAK, reported a regional difference in community mean and variance driven by contrasting hydrological settings (references). The more ocean-exposed Kachemak Bay exhibited interannual variability in taxonomic structure correlated with temperature, salinity, and turbidity; whereas, community variability in the more freshwater-exposed Lynn Canal had a weak interannual effect and instead exhibited stronger seasonal effects relating to salinity and watershed discharge (reference). This same study looked at functional diversity, which had not previously been done on nearshore fish communities in Alaska, and found weak correlations with local conditions in both systems. This suggests that if temporal shifts occur (over years) in nearshore fish communities then drivers are likely operating at larger spatial scales instead of smaller ones.

Community analysis was developed recognizing ecological principles based on species interactions and was meant to address questions of biodiversity, distribution, management, and change over time, where single-taxa studies were either inadequate (e.g., too costly or time consuming to string together) or simply inappropriate (e.g., need for samples coupling multiple taxa).

-   Community ecology based on species distributions, abundances, and possible interactions

-   Metacommunity framework dictates 4 paradigms:

    -   Neutral theory (null) -

        -   defined by slow, random patterns of compositional change in space and through time

        -   unlike other approaches, there is no presumption of species difference in niche relationships with local factors and/or in abilities to disperse or avoid local extinctions

        -   differences in local and regional diversity are random, or else could be explained by the other paradigms

    -   Patch-dynamics (dispersal among identical localities) -

        -   built on dispersal/extinction theory, considering homogeneous patches

        -   possible 'occupancy model' can lead to patches that are either vacant or occupied by populations at equilibrium when patches are identical

        -   regional coexistence can happen when species trade-offs exist between fitness/fecundity and dispersal

        -   dispersal can be constrained by predation and competition

        -   distinct time scales between local dynamics and regional 'colonization-extinction' dynamics

    -   Species-sorting (niche separation and coexistence) -

        -   built on theories of community change over environmental gradients, considering heterogeneous patches

        -   possible 'assembly model' where trade-offs among species lead to habitat specialization, where populations are at equilibrium behavior (stable point, oscillating, complex attractor) between colonization events and before extinctions caused by environmental perturbations

        -   local community compositions track changes in local environment (sharp or gradual) but maintain correspondence between local conditions and composition

        -   metacommunities can stabilize when local communities repeat assembly cycles as alternative states given sufficient heterogeneity among patches

        -   mass-effects are unlikely when immigration occurs at high levels but does not influence local communities, which will exhibit good correspondence between composition and conditions

    -   Mass-effects (density-dependent species interactions)

        -   built on probabilistic rules of population size and classical MacArthur consumer-resource model of species competition

        -   local population dynamics are quantitatively affected by dispersal, meaning no separation of time scales between local dynamics and competition-extinction dynamics

        -   introduces constraint of regional similarity, where coexisting species differ in ability to inhabit a patch type (MacArthur), but also compensating differences in abilities to compete and disperse make them similar at the regional scale

        -   metacommunity coexistence occurs via regional compensation, leading to species that are locally different but regionally similar (Amarasekare and Nisbet 2001)

While nearshore fish research in Alaska has been built over multiple decades, the information available in the literature lacks cohesion in terms of data analyses, ecological interpretation, and future outlook at the community level. In the last decade, other branches of ecology have led the way in performing analyses from a community perspective (e.g., multivariate inference models, joint species distributions, variable reduction). Some of these methods have already been applied to Alaskan nearshore fish communities, namely ordination and ANOVA based approaches. However, broad-scale analyses are still a gap considering the breadth of available datasets in both time and space compared to what has been done in other parts of the world. My dissertation aims to develop a cohesive understanding of nearshore fish community variability at the local-to-system scale, as well as at the region-to-region scale, and to examine if and how communities have changed over longer time periods. In my opinion, these are requisite analyses that will result in useful outcomes for fisheries management and ecosystem models, and will lead to next step analyses like those found in other branches of ecology.

# Proposed chapters

For chapter 1, I ask which physicochemical parameters and habitat factors structure nearshore fish communities within a system. Namely, I examine variance partitioned among temperature, salinity, tubidity, bay location, and site exposure (protected vs exposed) as water velocity. The goal of this chapter is to build upon existing knowledge of a well-studied system, and further our understanding of system-wide influences on community structuring.

-   

For chapter 2, I ask how nearshore fish communities are structured at varying spatial scales. In this chapter I expand the scale of study to include samples spread across multiple systems, first examining spatial autocorrelation and then parsing community variance among grouped samples (system-to-regional scales) with coastal habitat features that vary at the local level. The goal of this chapter is to uilize the range of data available in Alaska (namely the Gulf of Alaska) to empirically determine appropriate spatial groupings of community samples for further analyses.

-   @Dray.etal.2012

-   metacommunity, multiscale spatial analysis

For chapter 3, I ask if and how nearshore fish communities have changed over long-term periods (years-to-decades) coinciding with known climate-related trends. Specifically, I look for patterns in community variability surrounding the marine heatwave that affected the Gulf of Alaska from 2014-2016. The goal of this chapter is to apply findings from other nearshore fish research which hypothesized effects on nursery function during years with anomalously warm water temperatures.

# Approach

An early review of initial nearshore fish community assessments described a variety of gear types utilized, including trawls, seines, passive nets (e.g., gill, try, fyke), hook-and-line, and SCUBA. Each gear type resulted in different community assemblages, but seining methods typically produce the lowest selectivity. Beach seines specifically target shallow inshore waters usually \<5 m [method details in @Domke.etal.2024], and efficiently capture post-settlement juveniles - e.g., after larval transport in gadids and flatfish, or during outmigration in salmonids. In chapter 1, I collect new data in the study area of Kachemak Bay which represents a relatively well-studied system in terms of historical community assessments and published findings. This will provide me with a firm grasp of the sampling method, which will allow for a better understanding of how samples should be treated in data preparation and analyses. In chapters 2 and 3, I leverage the NOAA Nearshore Fish Atlas of Alaska database which aggregates data from numerous studies (\~20) conducted over multiple years (ca. 1990s to present). I will subset the NFAA and perform data preparations to fit the research question in either chapter. Although, I expect to focus on data collected from the GOA broadly (from SEAK to Aleutian Islands) due to the density of studies on hand, as well as existing broad-scale ecosystem definitions (e.g., east vs west GOA) that can be tested using nearshore fish data which would be novel.
