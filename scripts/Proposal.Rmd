# Instructions

Please follow the following guidelines when submitting the research proposal with your GSP:
- A research proposal should typically be less than 10 pages.
- Students are expected to include the following elements into the proposal:
  - Introduction
      - The introduction should give some background information on your research topic and your system (region and habitat)
      - The introduction should address
        1. Why are you doing this?
        2. Why should we care about this?
        3. What is known about this topic?
        4. What are you contributing to the existing knowledge?
      - The introduction should demonstrate that you have researched this topic area
        - You need some references in your introduction to demonstrate that you have researched your topic.
  - Research question
    - Clearly state your hypothesis or questions and research objectives. It is okay to just have one hypothesis or question.
      - Good resources to refer too:
        - ESA guide: Scientific Writing Made Easy: A Step‐by‐Step Guide to undergraduate Writing in the Biological Sciences.
        - Purdue guide: Writing is a Conversation - Purdue OWL
    - Methods
      - A methods section that shows you have thought about how you are going to address your question/hypothesis from sampling/experimental design to statistical analysis tools.
    - Timeline
      - Add a preliminary timeline on what is happening where and when (could be a table or Gantt diagram).
    - References
      - A reference section. Please ensure that the references are cited correctly. Please choose the style of an appropriate journal for your topic. We strongly recommend using a reference manager, such as Mendeley, to make this task easier and less prone to errors.
