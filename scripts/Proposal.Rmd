## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# Packages
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(here)

# Directory
wd = here()
dirs = wd %>% list.files() %>% str_subset(pattern = "^README|^LICENSE|.md$|.Rproj$", negate = TRUE)
for (i in seq_along(dirs)) {
  name = str_replace_all(dirs[i], "^", "dir.")
  path = str_replace_all(dirs[i], "^", str_c(wd, "/"))
  assign(name, path)
  rm(name, path, i)
}

# Options

# Source

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r plots, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
