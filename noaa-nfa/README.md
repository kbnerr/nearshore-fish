Directory for NOAA Nearshore Fish Atlas contributions. Each year's data submission is produced using a unique R script (except 2007 Homer Harbor data which was extracted from archived KBNERR files) due to individual project peculiarities. R scripts develop .csv files that are then shaped into .xlsx  manually. The .csv files are removed for redundancy but could be run anytime to re-do submission datasets. Data submissions were re-wrangled in March 2022.
